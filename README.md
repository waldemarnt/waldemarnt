### Hey ðŸ‘‹ A little bit about me

From open-source MMORPG emulators when I was 16 years old to developing professionally, I'm passionate about software development!

I'm open source collaborator, speaker and author, actually working as Software Engineer at Atlassian in Sydney. I enjoy working with agile methodologies to deliver large-scale products. In my free time, I like contributing to the communities I love, such as Javascript, Node.js, Docker, DevOps and Elastic.

I've been working professionally as a Software Engineer for approximately ten years and have worked in great companies. I believe that people should be capable of doing their job without bureaucracy; I advocate about horizontal cultures and teams where everybody has the opportunity to do their best.

Technically I enjoy large-scale systems architecture, micro-services, DevOps culture, cloud and quality.
In the last year, I wrote the book ["Building testable APIs with Node.js"](https://leanpub.com/construindo-apis-testaveis-com-nodejs/) which is entirely free for the Brazilian community. Also, I have a [blog](https://walde.co/) and [channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/waldemaneto/videos), where I publish content frequently.
