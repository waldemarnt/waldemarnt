From developing open-source MMORPG emulators at the age of 16 to working as a professional software engineer at Atlassian in Sydney at the age of 30, I am passionate about software development!

I am an open-source collaborator, speaker, and author who enjoys working with agile methodologies to deliver large-scale products. In my free time, I like to contribute to the communities that I love, such as Javascript, Node.js, Docker, DevOps, and Elastic.

I have been working professionally as a software engineer for approximately ten years and have worked for great companies. I believe that people should be capable of doing their job without bureaucracy. I advocate for horizontal cultures and teams where everybody has the opportunity to do their best.

Technically, I enjoy working with large-scale systems architecture, micro-services, DevOps culture, cloud computing, and quality. In the past year, I wrote the book ["Building testable APIs with Node.js"](https://leanpub.com/construindo-apis-testaveis-com-nodejs/) which is entirely free for the Brazilian community. Additionally, I maintain a [blog](https://walde.co/) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/waldemaneto/videos), where I frequently publish content.
